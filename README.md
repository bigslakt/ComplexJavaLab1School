# Schoolproject

Small project for teaching purposes.

* Wildfly
* JEE 8 
* Java 11
* Git
* Maven
* MySQL

## Wildfly configuration

Install any Wildfly release you want. I use 18.

Add a user, and place the school.cli script under the bin folder.<br>
Create database school. The script will need a mysql connector under `C:\Users`
to work. 

The script is predefined for `mysql.connector-java-8.0.12.jar`. Change location and version for your own liking.

Start Wildfly, and once running, open a new prompt, and go to the bin folder.<br>
Write `jboss-cli -c --file=school.cli`

It should say outcome success. Write `jboss-cli -c --command=:reload` to restart the server.
